# Gender-Classification-using-Twitter-Feeds


Accurate prediction of demographic attributes from social media like Twitter or Face book is valuable for marketing, personalization and legal investigation. We try to construct a large, multi-lingual dataset labeled with gender, and investigate statistic models for determining the gender of Twitter users. A large number of potential application areas like Human Computer Interaction, Targeted Advertising, Biometrics, Surveillance Systems, etc., need the gender classification. We tokenize the tweets and verify how this tokenization affects accuracy. We then perform Error Analysis using Logistic Regression to get the top coefficients.

The data we use for the project comes from Twitter API. The label data to train the model comes from the Census name list. In pre-processing step, we extract all the male and female names from the list. We sample the U.S tweets with names from Census and tokenize the tweets. In Feature extraction step, we convert feature vector matrix from the tokenized list and create a list of gender labels. We then fit a Logistic Regression Classifier to predict the gender from profile / tweet. Twitter provides an API to connect to its server and extract the user tweets from it. Initially, we construct a Twitter API object with all the required parameters and get access to Twitter. Then we extract the data from it
